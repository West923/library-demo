(2, 'Guy Gavriel', 'Kay', '1954-', 'Kay was born in Weyburn, Saskatchewan, and raised in Winnipeg, Manitoba, both in Canada. His background is Jewish.\r\nWhen Christopher Tolkien needed an assistant to edit his father J. R. R. Tolkien''s unpublished work, he chose Kay, then a student of philosophy at the University of Manitoba, whose parents were friends of Baillie Tolkien''s parents. Kay moved to Oxford in 1974 to assist Tolkien in the editing of The Silmarillion. There he learnt a lot about writing and editing[clarification needed], and later admitted of Tolkien''s influence, "to be successful in fantasy, you have to take the measure of Tolkien — work with his strengths and away from his weaknesses".[3]\r\nHe returned to Canada in 1976 to finish a law degree at the University of Toronto, and became interested in writing fiction.\r\nKay became Principal Writer and Associate Producer for a Canadian Broadcasting Corporation radio series, The Scales of Justice.\r\nIn 1984, Kay''s first fantasy work, The Summer Tree, the first volume of the trilogy The Fionavar Tapestry, was published.\r\nMost of Kay''s subsequent works have a link to the realm of Fionavar, even if it is only a single reference to "... the first of all worlds...".\r\nKay is married to Laura Beth Cohen.\r\nRetrieved from Wikipedia, May 5, 2013'),

He served two tours in Vietnam (from 1968 to 1970) with the United States Army as a helicopter gunner. He was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross with oak leaf cluster, the Bronze Star with "V" and oak leaf cluster, and two Vietnamese Gallantry Crosses with palm. After returning from Vietnam he attended The Citadel where he received an undergraduate degree in physics. After graduating he was employed by the United States Navy as a nuclear engineer. He began writing in 1977. He was a history buff and enjoyed hunting, fishing, sailing, poker, chess, pool, and pipe collecting. He described himself as a "High Church" Episcopalian and received communion more than once a week. He lived with his wife Harriet McDougal, who works as a book editor (currently with Tor Books; she was also Jordan''s editor) in a house built in 1797.[8] Responding to queries on the similarity of some of the concepts in his Wheel of Time books with Freemasonry concepts, Jordan admitted that he was a Freemason. However, "like his father and grandfather," he preferred not to advertise, possibly because of the negative propaganda against Freemasonry. In his own words, "no man in this country should feel in danger because of his beliefs."\r\nRetrieved from Wikipdedia May 5, 2013'),

(20, 'Alan', 'Bradley', '1938-', 'Bradley had been interested in writing his entire life. However, he began to take it more seriously in his early 30s after moving to Saskatoon. There, he joined several writing groups and began spending time with local writers.\r\nHe wrote several short stories that were read on CBC Radio and published in literary magazines. Following his early retirement from the University of Saskatchewan in 1994, Bradley and his wife Shirley moved to Kelowna, British Columbia for her work, while Bradley focused full-time on writing. He wrote multiple screenplays over the course of nine years. Then, during the 2003 Okanagan Mountain Park Fire, many homes neighbouring Bradley''s were destroyed, although his was spared from the fire. The experience inspired him to do something different, and he began focusing on memoirs instead of screenplays. He wrote a non-fiction book called Ms Holmes of Baker Street and a memoir called The Shoebox Bible. In 2006, he began writing his first novel.\r\nSoon after, Bradley''s wife was listening to CBC Radio as Louise Penny, a Canadian mystery author, discussed the Debut Dagger fiction competition, run by the U.K. Crime Writers'' Association and sponsored by the Orion Publishing Group in Britain. The competition requires that entrants submit the first chapter and a synopsis of a murder mystery. Bradley''s wife encouraged him to write something new about the "girl on the camp stool", a minor character that had emerged in the novel Bradley was working on. In early 2007, Bradley entered the Dagger contest by submitting fifteen pages about said character, now named Flavia de Luce. These pages, which took only a few days to write and several weeks of polishing, would become the basis of The Sweetness at the Bottom of the Pie. Bradley set the book in England despite having never visited it. In June 2007, two judges from the contest contacted Bradley''s agent in Canada to express interest in publishing the proposed book; they also inadvertently informed him that Bradley was the winner of the competition. A bidding war ensued, and on June 27, 2007, Bradley sold Orion the rights for three books in Britain. Within several days, Doubleday had purchased the Canadian rights and Bantam Books the U.S. rights. At age 69, Bradley left North America for the first time when he went to London, England to pick up the Dagger award on July 5, 2007.\r\nUpon his return to Canada after the award ceremony, Bradley took a few weeks off, and then spent seven months turning the submitted fifteen pages into a full-length novel. The Sweetness at the Bottom of the Pie was published in the UK in January 2009 and in Canada in February 2009. The book has since developed into a six-part series about young Flavia de Luce solving various crimes in a 1950s village. The second installment (The Weed That Strings the Hangman''s Bag) was published in March 2010, the third (A Red Herring without Mustard) in February 2011, the fourth (I Am Half-Sick of Shadows) in December 2011, and the fifth (Speaking from Among the Bones) in January 2013.\r\nIn 2012, director Sam Mendes optioned the Flavia de Luce series, which he intends to develop into TV movies.\r\nRetrieved from Wikipedia May 5, 2013'),

Many of their novels have become bestsellers, and one, Relic, was adapted into a feature film. Child and Preston''s books are notable for their thorough research.\r\nBorn in Westport, Connecticut, but now a New Jersey resident, Child graduated from Carleton College in Northfield, Minnesota, with a major in English.\r\nSoon afterward, in 1979, he secured a job as an editorial assistant at St. Martin''s Press. By 1984, Child had become full editor. While in this position, he edited hundreds of books, most titles being American and English fiction.\r\nIn 1987 after founding the company''s mass-market horror division, Child left the St. Martin''s Press to become a Systems Analyst at MetLife. Child''s first novel, Relic, was published in 1995. He left the company a few years later to write full time.\r\nChild is now a resident of Morristown, New Jersey.\r\nRetrieved from Wikipdia May 5, 2013'),
(42, 'Douglas', 'Preston', '1956-', 'A graduate of the Cambridge School of Weston in Weston, Massachusetts, and Pomona College in Claremont, California, Preston began his writing career at the American Museum of Natural History in New York. In addition to his collaborations with Child, he has written several novels and non-fiction books of his own, mainly dealing with the history of the American Southwest. He is a contributing writer for Smithsonian, The Atlantic Monthly, and The New Yorker magazines. He has two brothers: David Preston (a medical doctor) and Richard Preston, also a best-selling fiction/non-fiction author.\r\nMost of Preston''s five nonfiction books and fifteen novels were bestsellers and have been translated into many languages. With his frequent collaborator, Lincoln Child, he has co-authored such bestselling thrillers as The Cabinet of Curiosities, The Ice Limit, Thunderhead, Riptide, Brimstone and Relic. Their novel, Cold Vengeance, which came out in August 2011, reached number 1 on the New York Times bestseller list. Preston writes about archeology for the New Yorker magazine and he has also been published in Smithsonian magazine, Harper''s, and National Geographic. He is the recipient of numerous writing awards. He has created the character Wyman Ford, an ex-CIA agent who appears in many of his solo novels.\r\nFrom 1978 to 1985, Preston worked for the American Museum of Natural History in New York City as a writer, editor, and manager of publications. He served as Managing Editor for the journal Curator and was a columnist for Natural History magazine. In 1985 he published a history of the museum, Dinosaurs In The Attic: An Excursion into the American Museum of Natural History, which chronicled the explorers and expeditions of the museum''s early days. In 1989 and 1990 he taught nonfiction writing at Princeton University.\r\nIn 1986 Preston moved to New Mexico and began to write full-time. Seeking an understanding of the first moment of contact between Europeans and Indians in America, he retraced on horseback Francisco Vasquez de Coronado''s violent and unsuccessful search for the legendary Seven Cities of Gold. That thousand mile journey across the American Southwest resulted in the book Cities of Gold: A Journey Across the American Southwest. Since that time Preston has undertaken many long horseback journeys retracing historic or prehistoric trails. He has also participated in expeditions in other parts of the world, including a journey deep into Khmer Rouge-held territory in the Cambodian jungle with a small army of soldiers, to be the first Westerner to visit a lost Angkor temple. He once had the thrill of being the first person in 3,000 years to enter an ancient Egyptian burial chamber in a tomb known as KV5 in the Valley of the Kings.\r\nIn May, 2011, Pomona College conferred on Preston the degree of Doctor of Letters, (Honoris Causa).\r\nPreston counts in his collateral ancestry the newspaperman Horace Greeley, the infamous murderer and opium addict Amasa Greenough, the sexologist Robert Latou Dickinson and the poet Emily Dickinson. He and his wife, Christine, live in Santa Fe, New Mexico.\r\nRetrieved May 5, 2013 from Wikipedia'),
(43, 'George R. R. ', 'Martin', '1948-', 'George R. R. Martin was born on September 20, 1948, in Bayonne, New Jersey, the son of longshoreman Raymond Collins Martin and his wife Margaret Brady Martin who also had two daughters, sisters Darleen and Janet. The family lived in a federal housing project near to the Bayonne docks. Being poor, the young Martin lived in his imagination and began writing and selling monster stories for pennies to other neighborhood children, dramatic readings included. He also wrote stories about a mythical kingdom populated by his pet turtles; the turtles died frequently in their toy castle, so he finally decided they were killing each other off in "sinister plots." Martin attended Mary Jane Donohoe School and then later Marist High School. While there he became an avid comic book fan, developing a strong interest in the innovative superheroes being published by Marvel Comics. Fantastic Four No. 20 (Nov 1963) printed a letter Martin wrote to the editor, the first of many sent, e.g., FF #32, #34, and others from his family''s home at 35 E. First Street, Bayonne, NJ. Other fans wrote him letters, and through such contacts Martin joined the fledgling comics fandom of the era, writing fiction for various fanzines. In 1965 Martin won comic fandom''s Alley Award for his prose superhero story "Powerman vs. The Blue Barrier," the first of many awards he would go on to win for his fiction.\r\nIn 1970 Martin earned a B. S. in Journalism from Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois, graduating summa cum laude; he went on to complete his M. S. in Journalism in 1971, also from Northwestern. Eligible for the draft during the Vietnam War, to which he objected, Martin applied for and obtained conscientious objector status; he instead did alternative service work for two years (1972–1974) as a VISTA volunteer, attached to the Cook County Legal Assistance Foundation. He also directed chess tournaments for the Continental Chess Association from 1973 to 1976. Then from 1976 to 1978 he was an English and journalism instructor at Clarke University (then Clarke College) in Dubuque, IA, becoming Writer In Residence at the college from 1978 to 1979.\r\nMartin began selling science fiction short stories professionally in 1970, at age 21. His first story, "The Hero", sold to Galaxy magazine and was published in its February 1971 issue; other sales soon followed. The first story of his nominated for the Hugo Award and the Nebula Award was With Morning Comes Mistfall, published in 1973 by Analog magazine. A member of the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America (SFWA), Martin became the organization''s Southwest Regional Director from 1977 to 1979; from 1996 to 1998 he served as its vice president.\r\nIn 1976, for Kansas City''s MidAmeriCon, the 34th World Science Fiction Convention (Worldcon), Martin and his friend and fellow writer-editor Gardner Dozois conceived of and organized the first Hugo Losers Party for the benefit of all past and present Hugo-losing writers, their friends, and family the evening following the convention''s Hugo Awards ceremony. Martin was nominated for two Hugos that year but ultimately wound up losing both awards, for the novelette "...and Seven Times Never Kill Man" and the novella The Storms of Windhaven, co-written with Lisa Tuttle. The Hugo Losers Party became an annual Worldcon event thereafter, its formal title eventually evolving into something a little more politically correct as both its size and prestige grew.\r\nAlthough much of his work is fantasy or horror, a number of his earlier works are science fiction occurring in a loosely defined future history, known informally as "The Thousand Worlds" or "The Manrealm". He has also written at least one piece of political-military fiction, "Night of the Vampyres", collected in Harry Turtledove''s anthology The Best Military Science Fiction of the 20th Century.\r\nThe unexpected commercial failure of Martin''s fourth book, The Armageddon Rag (1983), "essentially destroyed my career as a novelist at the time", he recalled. It began his career in television, however, as a result of a Hollywood option on that novel that then led to him being hired, first as a staff writer and then as an Executive Story Consultant, for the revival of the Twilight Zone. When the CBS series ran its course, Martin and other Twilight Zone staff writers migrated over to the already underway satirical science fiction series Max Headroom. While there he wrote scripts and created the show''s Ped Xing character, the president of the Zic Zak corporation, Network 23''s primary sponsor. Before his completed scripts could go into production, the ABC show was canceled in the middle of its second season. Martin then became a producer on the dramatic fantasy series Beauty and the Beast; in 1989 he became the show''s co-supervising producer. During this same period, he also worked in print media as a book series editor, overseeing the development of the lengthy and still on-going Wild Cards series, which takes place in a shared universe in which a small slice of post–World War II humanity gains superpowers after the release of an alien-engineered virus. In Second Person Martin "gives a personal account of the close-knit role-playing game (RPG) culture that gave rise to his Wild Cards shared-world anthologies". Martin''s own contributions to the multiple-author series often feature Thomas Tudbury, "The Great and Powerful Turtle", a powerful psychokinetic whose flying "shell" consisted of an armored VW Beetle. As of June 2011, 21 Wild Cards volumes had been published in the series; earlier that same year, Martin signed the contract for the 22nd volume,Low Ball, which has since been completed and will be published by Tor Books in mid-summer of 2014. In early 2012 Martin signed another Tor contract for the 23rd Wild Cards volume, High Stakes.\r\nMartin''s novella, Nightflyers, was adapted into a 1987 feature film of the same title; he was not happy about having to cut plot elements for the screenplay''s scenario in order to accommodate the film''s small budget.\r\nRetrieved from Wikipedia May 5, 2013'),
